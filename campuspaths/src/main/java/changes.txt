Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-pathfinder, and why you made those changes.

- implemented GraphNeighbors instead of StringGraphNeighbors in order to
be able to use Dijkstra's in the staff-given library.

- made both my DirGraph ADT and Edge/Nodes inner-classes to be generic
in order to support weighted graphs and any other graphs with different
node/edge labels.

- Made my edge class non-static and added a method in my DirGraph that
creates and returns an Edge object so all edges that clients use will store
generified label types that the instance of DirGraph uses. Clients can use
those edges to represent paths of edges for that specific graph.

- Changed some method parameters from passing edges to passing node/edge data
such as when creating new edges, so that clients don't have to make Edge
objects themselves when calling those methods.
