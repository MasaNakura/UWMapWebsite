# UW Map Website # 

This is my code for the map website project for CSE 331 at the University of Washington. 
Check out the website here: [currently unavailable]

The website shows a map of the UW campus - a user can select two buildings and the site will display the shortest possible path calculated via Dijkstra's Algorithm. 
The magenta and blue dots show the start and end of the path. The exact directions will be shown at the very bottom of the webpage!
